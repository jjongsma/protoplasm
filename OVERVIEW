# Protoplasm

Protoplasm is a collection of javascript UI controls for web sites.
Its goal is to provide a rich user experience without confusing the
interface or creating a distraction. Simple design and clean lines
are always valued above fancy styling, and usability is the overriding
concern in all controls.

To include Protoplasm controls in a web page, just add the following
code to your &lt;head&gt; section:

	<script language="javascript" src="protoplasm.js"></script>

You can then tell Protoplasm to load the control(s) you will be using,
and which HTML elements should be transformed into enhanced controls
(use() must always be called from the page &lt;head&gt; section):

	<script language="javascript">
		Protoplasm.use('datepicker').transform('input.datepicker');
	</script>

Protoplasm requires <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prototypejs.org">Prototype</a>.
Although including Prototype in your page is recommended, Protoplasm
will automatically load it for you from the
<a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/">Google
Libraries API</a> if it is not found.
